# Alternative Models

Comparative results and notes on other EQ benchmarks.

This section highlights evaluations for models beyond SERA-X. It provides context on how different approaches address emotional intelligence tasks and where they excel or fall short. Use these notes to better understand the landscape of available benchmarks.

## Notable Frameworks

### MSCEIT
The **Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)** is a performance-based measure for human emotional intelligence. It evaluates how well people perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions.  
**Key publication:** Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso (2002). *MSCEIT User’s Manual.*

**Advantages**
- Psychometrically validated for assessing human EI skills.

**Limitations relative to SERA-X**
- Designed for human testing, so it lacks direct computational metrics for AI systems.

### EQ-i (Bar-On Model)
The **Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i)** focuses on emotional-social intelligence, including self-awareness, empathy, and interpersonal effectiveness.  
**Key publication:** Bar-On (2006). "The Bar-On model of emotional-social intelligence."

**Advantages**
- Broad coverage of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills.

**Limitations relative to SERA-X**
- Primarily a self-report instrument, making it difficult to operationalize for AI evaluation.

### Affective Computing Models
**Affective computing** provides computational methods to detect and synthesize emotion signals. It underpins many emotion-recognition algorithms used in AI today.  
**Key publication:** Picard (1997). *Affective Computing*. MIT Press.

**Advantages**
- Offers algorithms for emotion recognition and expression.

**Limitations relative to SERA-X**
- Often emphasizes low-level detection without the broader interpretive and adaptive framework SERA-X supplies.

SERA-X extends these foundations by combining psychometric insights with explicit computational metrics across sensing, explaining, responding, and adapting to emotions in AI systems.
