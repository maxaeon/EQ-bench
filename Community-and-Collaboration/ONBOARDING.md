# Interdisciplinary Onboarding

Welcome to the AI EQ Research Hub project. This short guide explains how researchers from many fields can collaborate.

## How you can contribute
- **Psychologists** – propose constructs and help interpret results. Use the [reference](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/reference.yml) and [construct](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/construct.yml) issue templates to submit sources and experiment ideas.
- **Philosophers** – refine ethical perspectives and conceptual approaches through [feedback issues](https://github.com/maxaeon/EQ-bench/issues/new?template=feedback.yml) or GitHub Discussions.
- **Engineers and data scientists** – build evaluation tools and datasets. See our [quick GitHub guide](../docs/quick_github_guide.md) for tips on forks and pull requests.
- **Everyone** – expand the shared literature review on Overleaf (link in [docs/phase1.html](../docs/phase1.html#be11ce)). Please follow our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Next steps
1. Read the [quick GitHub guide](../docs/quick_github_guide.md).
2. Browse the [issue templates](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) to start a discussion or propose additions.
3. Join the Overleaf project to help synthesize interdisciplinary references.
4. Review the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep interactions respectful.
