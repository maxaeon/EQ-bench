# AI EQ Research Hub

Welcome to the **AI EQ Research Hub**. We are committed to collaboratively developing, refining, and promoting standardized benchmarks for assessing emotional intelligence in artificial intelligence systems, anchored around the leading **SERA-X** model. You can find our deployed page [here](https://maxaeon.github.io/EQ-bench/). 

GitHub Discussions are enabled for open dialogue and interdisciplinary collaboration.

This website serves as the foundational resource and single source of truth for all project collaborators.

Status: *early scaffold* (v0.0.1) - layout may change

## 1  Project Snapshot
SERA-X is intended to be a collaborative benchmark for evaluating emotional intelligence in AI systems. This repository collects design documents and sample datasets as they become available. Authorized visitors can sign in using the **Login** button at the top right of the project website and submit new sources or constructs directly through the provided forms. Use the same button to log out when finished. These entries are stored in our Supabase tables (`literature` and `constructs`) and mirrored JSON files under `data/`. For guidance, see [docs/persisting_constructs.md](docs/persisting_constructs.md) and the [Research Hub Contribution Guide](docs/quick_github_guide.md).

## 2  Why SERA-X?
Emotional intelligence in AI should not be judged by a single pass/fail label.  
We model it as four independent, graded skills, along with an extended perspective:

| Axis | Short description | Pilot metric (text-only) |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sense** | Detect user emotion from language | Macro-F1 on 10 emotion labels |
| **Explain** | Infer probable causes / appraisals | Cause-Inference Accuracy |
| **Respond** | Generate helpful, empathic replies | Human Empathy Score (HES 1-5) |
| **Adapt** | Retain performance on new cultures & slang | Œî-F1 across ‚ÄúExperience Packs‚Äù |
| **Extended** | Evaluates AI's performance across diverse human-AI interaction levels. | Composite score from multi-modal interaction assessments. |

### Theoretical Foundations
Underlying this interdisciplinary methodology are several Theoretical Foundations, essential to guiding and informing our approach to emotional intelligence assessment. These foundations provide crucial context and ensure conceptual coherence by defining the ethical considerations, methodological principles, and disciplinary frameworks that inform how emotional intelligence constructs are identified, understood, measured, and interpreted within the SERA-X project. Understanding these theoretical foundations is vital to appreciating the comprehensive, responsible, and rigorous nature of our emotional intelligence benchmarks.

| Theoretical Foundation | Brief Description | Disciplinary Origin | Primary Reference(s) | Role in Project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Affective Computing | Computational methods for recognizing, interpreting, and simulating human emotions. | Computer Science | Picard, R. (1997). Affective Computing. MIT Press. | Provides computational models for sensing and interpreting emotion signals, shaping data collection and scoring rules for the Sense and Explain metrics. |
| Ethical AI Development | Normative principles and ethical frameworks guiding fair, inclusive, and responsible development of AI systems. | Ethics, Philosophy | Coeckelbergh (2020). AI Ethics. MIT Press. | Defines review protocols and fairness audits that shape the evaluation methodology and metrics across all axes. |
| Extended Mind | Cognition extends beyond the individual to include tools and environment. | Philosophy, Cognitive Science | Clark, A., & Chalmers, D. (1998). The Extended Mind. *Analysis.* | Grounds the "Extended" axis and shapes human‚ÄìAI interaction metrics by framing the system and user as a single cognitive loop. |

### Project website

The `docs/` folder doubles as a GitHub Pages site.
Visit <https://maxaeon.github.io/EQ-bench/> for a short overview of the project and direct forms for submitting constructs or literature references. Entries submitted through these forms are stored in `data/construct_submissions.json` and `data/literature.json` and mirrored in our Supabase tables. See [docs/persisting_constructs.md](docs/persisting_constructs.md) and the [Research Hub Contribution Guide](docs/quick_github_guide.md) for details. Selected references can be downloaded as a BibTeX file, or uploaded/pasted back into the database. If you have a DOI, you can convert it to a BibTeX entry using online tools such as [bibtex.com](https://www.bibtex.com/c/doi-to-bibtex-converter/).
When exporting, extra fields such as the construct name, supported methodology, or SERA-X axis are omitted to keep the BibTeX file portable. Any keywords are written to the standard `keywords` tag and relevance notes appear under `note`. During import the site prompts for any missing required values.
For a walkthrough of the import/export buttons, see the [quick guide section on BibTeX files](docs/quick_github_guide.md#importing-and-exporting-bib-files).

### Merging BibTeX references (maintainers)
Run the helper script after collecting new `.bib` citations:

```bash
python scripts/merge_bibtex.py path/to/references.bib
```

This updates `data/literature.json` and mirrors it to `docs/data/literature.json` after deduplicating entries by title and DOI.

To export the curated JSON back into a single BibTeX file run:

```bash
python scripts/export_bibtex.py references.bib
```

### Migrating JSON snapshots to Supabase
If you need to seed the Supabase tables from the versioned JSON files, run:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://pzmmgpzcnjhivkizcvpp.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="<service role key>"
node scripts/upload_to_supabase.js
```

The script reads `data/construct_submissions.json` and `data/literature.json`,
inserting them into the `constructs` and `literature` tables respectively.

To generate CSV files for Supabase's bulk import tool instead of using the API,
run:

```bash
python scripts/json_to_csv.py
```

This writes `data/construct_submissions.csv` and `data/literature.csv` that can
be uploaded through the Supabase dashboard.
