Other studies reported ChatGPT-based models achieving high empathy ratings (e.g. 3.43 out of 4) and higher emotional awareness scores than human averages\u200b. That said, researchers noted limitations such as chatbots relying on repetitive \u201cempathetic\u201d phrases or producing overly lengthy replies\u200b.
