# Ethical Standards

Frameworks and guidelines for responsible emotional intelligence benchmarking.

Maintaining ethical integrity is central to the project. This directory collects best practices and policy references to ensure benchmarks respect privacy and cultural differences. Contributors should review these materials to align their work with responsible AI principles.

## Practical Guidelines

- **Responsible data gathering**
  - Obtain informed consent for any human-sourced data.
  - Avoid scraping private or copyrighted materials without permission.
  - Store sensitive records securely with limited access.

- **Annotation**
  - Provide clear labeling instructions and a consistent emotion taxonomy.
  - Capture uncertainty or edge cases in `annotator_notes`.
  - Involve multiple reviewers to reduce bias.

- **Inclusivity practices**
  - Invite contributions from diverse communities and backgrounds.
  - Document cultural context and language variety for each dataset.
  - Encourage feedback from marginalized groups during reviews.

- **Reporting ethical concerns**
  - Open a private GitHub issue or email the project lead, Max Parks, at `maxaeonparks@gmail.com`.
  - Describe the concern and reference any related files or discussions.
  - Maintainers aim to respond within **7 days**.
