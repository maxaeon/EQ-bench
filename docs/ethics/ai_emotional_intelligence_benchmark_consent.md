**Project Title:** AI Emotional Intelligence Benchmark Project  
**Project Lead:** Max Parks
**Affiliation:** University of Michigan–Flint  
**Funding Provided By:** Inflection AI
**Research independence:** Funding sources do not influence methods or reporting; our interdisciplinary team strives for an unbiased, gold-standard EQ benchmark.
**Collaborator:** Mark Allison, Department of Computer Science, University of Michigan–Flint
**Version:** v0.1 | Drafted June 4, 2025

This benchmark is developed by the community and is expected to be stewarded by **ML Commons** once mature.

## 🔍 What is this research about?

This project explores how well AI systems can **detect**, **explain**, **respond to**, and **adapt** to emotional cues in natural language. The AI Emotional Intelligence Benchmark is designed to evaluate these capabilities in a structured and interpretable way. Your participation will help us ensure that emotional intelligence in AI is assessed in ways that are rigorous, fair, and grounded in lived experience.

## 🙋 What will I be asked to do?

Depending on your role, you may be invited to:

- Submit or annotate short, de-identified dialogue excerpts involving emotional content  
- Rate the emotional appropriateness or helpfulness of model responses  
- Participate in co-design of benchmark items or provide expert input  
- Review or categorize emotional phenomena (e.g., adaptation, misrecognition, cultural framing)

You may opt out of any specific task, and participation in each activity is entirely voluntary.

## 🔐 Will my identity be protected?

Yes. We will not collect or store your name, contact details, or other personally identifying information unless you choose to share it for follow-up or co-authorship purposes. Please ensure that any data you contribute has been anonymized and does not include sensitive client or third-party details.

Your submissions may be used to help train, test, or benchmark AI systems, but **only in anonymized form**, and never in ways that expose private or proprietary information.

## 🧠 Are there any risks?

There is minimal risk. Some of the data may involve emotionally sensitive topics (e.g., mental health, grief, or trauma-related content). You are free to skip any examples that feel uncomfortable.

## 🎁 Is there compensation?

Some contributions (especially large annotation or rating sets) may be compensated, either through external funding or academic collaboration. You will be informed in advance if a specific task is eligible for compensation. Other contributions may be made on a voluntary basis and acknowledged appropriately.

## ✅ What happens to my data?

Any data you provide may be:

- Used internally to improve the benchmark and related tools  
- Shared with researchers or collaborators for analysis and evaluation  
- Included in research publications or open-access datasets (in anonymized form)

If you wish to withdraw your data after submission, please email the research team at the address below.
