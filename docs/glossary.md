# ðŸ“– Glossary

**SERA-X**
: An emotional intelligence benchmark short for **Sense, Explain, Respond, Adapt â€“ Extended**. It defines a set of axes and metrics for evaluating how well AI systems perceive and react to human emotions.

**construct**
: A specific emotional capability or trait measured by the benchmark. Constructs group related behaviors or skills that contribute to overall emotional intelligence.

**axis**
: One of the four core ability categories of SERA-Xâ€”*Sense*, *Explain*, *Respond*, and *Adapt* (with an extended perspective). Each axis captures a different dimension of emotional intelligence.

**Supabase**
: An open-source backend service used by this project to store submitted constructs and literature references. Form data from the project website is synced to Supabase tables for collaborative editing.

**AI Emotional Intelligence (AI-EQ)**
: The capacity of artificial intelligence systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human emotions.

**Cultural Adaptation**
: The ability of an AI system to adjust its emotional responses to align with diverse cultural norms and social contexts.

**Emotional Indicator**
: Any measurable signal or marker used to infer emotional states.

**Emotion Recognition**
: The AI's capability to accurately identify human emotions based on sensory input.

**Emotion Regulation**
: Techniques or processes used by AI to manage and respond appropriately to emotional situations.

**Explainability (XAI)**
: The feature of AI systems providing clear, interpretable reasons for their emotional responses or decisions.

**Human-AI Interaction**
: The dynamic exchange of information, emotions, and responses between humans and artificial intelligence systems.

**Mental State Inference**
: The process through which an AI system deduces the psychological or emotional state of a human.

**Responding Appropriately**
: Generating contextually suitable and emotionally intelligent responses within human-AI interactions.

**SERA-X Model**
: A structured model guiding the evaluation of emotional intelligence constructs in AI.

**Validation Methodology**
: Procedures or techniques employed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of identified emotional intelligence constructs.
