# Research Hub Contribution Guide

This guide shows how to contribute to the AI EQ Benchmark Research Hub using the GitHub interface and our collaborative Overleaf project. You can participate without installing any software.

## 1. Use the GitHub Pages interface

1. Visit <https://maxaeon.github.io/EQ-bench/>.
2. Log in when prompted and use the **Add Source** or **Add Construct** buttons to open the submission form.
3. Fill in the requested details and click **Save** to store the entry in Supabase.
4. On the **Phase&nbsp;1** page you can still upload your own `.bib` file for convenience. Uploaded entries appear locally until saved.

## 2. Convert references to BibTeX

When filling out a literature issue or sharing your own bibliography, convert each reference to a standard BibTeX entry. A quick way is to paste the DOI into an online converter such as [bibtex.com](https://www.bibtex.com/c/doi-to-bibtex-converter/). Copy the generated BibTeX text into a `.bib` file or the issue form.

## 3. Edit the literature review in Overleaf

1. On the Research Hub website, follow the link labeled "Access the collaborative Overleaf document."
2. Overleaf opens in Visual mode, so you can edit without knowing LaTeX.
3. Add your references or comments and press **Save**. Your changes are stored in the shared project.

## 4. Optional: Edit files on GitHub

1. Browse to any Markdown file in this repository.
2. Click the **pencil** icon to open GitHub's editor.
3. Enter your edits and give a short commit message.
4. After saving, GitHub will prompt you to open a pull request.

A maintainer will review your submission and merge it when ready. Thanks for helping improve the Research Hub!
