# Quick GitHub Guide

This short guide walks you through contributing using only the GitHub website.

## Steps

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of the project page. This creates your own copy.
2. **Edit a file**
   - Browse to any `.md` file and click the pencil icon to start editing.
3. **Propose changes**
   - After making edits, add a short description at the bottom of the page and click **Propose changes**.
4. **Open a pull request**
   - GitHub automatically prepares a pull request. Review the diff and click **Create pull request**.
5. **Discuss and iterate**
   - Maintainers will review your PR, run tests, and merge when everything looks good.

_Screenshots of each step will be added soon._
